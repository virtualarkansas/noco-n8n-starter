The frontend-design skill in this project is based on
[Impeccable](https://impeccable.style) by Paul Bakaus
(https://github.com/pbakaus/impeccable).

Impeccable is itself based on Anthropic's frontend-design skill.

Licensed under Apache 2.0.

The skill has been adapted for the NocoFlow Starter project to include
project-specific constraints (n8n webhook serving, Tailwind CSS CDN,
vanilla JavaScript, sandboxed iframe limitations).

The 7 reference guides and 17 slash commands are included unmodified
from the Impeccable distribution.
